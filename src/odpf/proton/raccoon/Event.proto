 `Event` defines wrapper of the event you want to push to Raccoon

 you want for your event. It can be as simple as JSON encoded key-value pair or complex
 protobuf schema that captures all metadata you want. The data then needs to be serialized to
 bytes and populate it in `eventBytes` field. Single `Event` contains one event.
